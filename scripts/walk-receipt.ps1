.SYNOPSIS
    The receipt a whole-app walk leaves, and what makes one good enough to publish a bundle on.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-sourced by release/release.ps1, whose publish stage refuses to publish a bundle without a
    receipt that backs it. Nothing goes public until an APK patched from the exact bundle being
    released has been walked end to end on a release phone or an emulator and came back PASS:
    every Hush settings page and every patched screen, with no Threads crash.

    The walk writes walk-receipt.json with New-WalkReceipt. It names the SHA-256 of the .mpp the
    walked APK was patched with, and publish holds that to the signed bundle it's about to upload,
    so a walk of any other build can't stand in for this one.
#>

# The phones release walks run on, by ro.product.model. An emulator passes by its serial.
